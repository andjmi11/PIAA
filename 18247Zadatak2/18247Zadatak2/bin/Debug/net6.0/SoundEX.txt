Right from their very first encounter, Albert Smulka, the newly appointed 
district reeve, reminded Geralt of a swede—he was stout, unwashed, thick- 
skinned and generally pretty dull. In other words, he didn’t differ much from all 
the other district clerks Geralt had dealt with. 



“Would seem to be true,” said the reeve. “Nought like a witcher for dealing 
with troubles. Jonas, my predecessor, couldn’t speak highly enough of you,” he 
continued a moment later, not waiting for any reaction from Geralt. “To think, I 
considered him a liar. I mean that I didn’t completely lend credence to him. I 
know how things can grow into fairy tales. Particularly among the common folk, 
with them there’s always either a miracle or a marvel, or some witcher with 
superhuman powers. And here we are, turns out it’s the honest truth. Uncounted 
people have died in that forest beyond the little river. And because it’s a shortcut 
to the town the fools went that way ... to their own doom. Heedless of warnings. 
These days it’s better not to loiter in badlands or wander through forests. 
Monsters and man-eaters everywhere. A dreadful thing has just happened in the 
Tukaj Hills of Temeria—a sylvan ghoul killed fifteen people in a charcoal- 
burners’ settlement. It’s called Rogovizna. You must have heard. Haven’t you? 
But it’s the truth, cross my heart and hope to die. It’s said even the wizardry 
have started an investigation in that there Rogovizna. Well, enough of stories. 
We’re safe here in Ansegis now. Thanks to you.” 

He took a coffer from a chest of drawers, spread out a sheet of paper on the 
table and dipped a quill in an inkwell. 

“You promised you’d kill the monster,” he said, without raising his head. 
“Seems you weren’t having me on. You’re a man of your word, for a vagabond 
... And you saved those people’s lives. That woman and the lass. Did they even 
thank you? Express their gratitude?” 

No, they didn’t. The Witcher clenched his jaw. Because they haven’t yet fully 
regained consciousness. And I’ll be gone before they do. Before they realise I 
used them as bait, convinced in my conceited arrogance that I was capable of 
saving all three of them. I’ll be gone before it dawns on the girl, before she 
understands I’m to blame for her becoming a half-orphan. 

He felt bad. No doubt because of the elixirs he’d taken before the fight. No 
doubt. 

“That monster is a right abomination.” The reeve sprinkled some sand over 
the paper, and then shook it off onto the floor. “I had a look at the carcass when 
they brought it here ... What on earth was it?” 

Geralt wasn’t certain in that regard, but didn’t intend to reveal his ignorance. 

“An arachnomorph.” 

Albert Smulka moved his lips, vainly trying to repeat the word. 

“Ugh, meks no difference, when all’s said and done. Did you dispatch it with 
that sword? With that blade? Can I take a look?” 



“No, you can’t.” 

“Ha, because it’s no doubt enchanted. And it must be dear ... Quite 
something ... Well, here we are jawing away and time’s passing. The task’s 
been executed, time for payment. But first the formalities. Make your mark on 
the bill. I mean, put a cross or some such.” 

The Witcher took the bill from Smulka and held it up to the light. 

“Look at ’im.” The reeve shook his head, grimacing. “What’s this, can he 
read?” 

Geralt put the paper on the table and pushed it towards the official. 

“A slight error has crept into the document,” he said, calmly and softly. “We 
agreed on fifty crowns. This bill has been made out for eighty.” 

Albert Smulka clasped his hands together and rested his chin on them. 

“It isn’t an error.” He also lowered his voice. “Rather, a token of gratitude. 
You killed the monster and I’m sure it was an exacting job ... So the sum won’t 
astonish anyone ...” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“Pull the other one. Don’t play the innocent. Trying to tell me that when 
Jonas was in charge he never made out bills like this? I swear I—” 

“What do you swear?” Geralt interrupted. “That he inflated bills? And went 
halves with me on the sum the royal purse was deprived of?” 

“Went halves?” the reeve sneered. “Don’t be soft, Witcher, don’t be soft. 
Reckon you’re that important? You’ll get a third of the difference. Ten crowns. 
It’s a decent bonus for you anyway. For I deserve more, if only owing to my 
function. State officials ought to be wealthy. The wealthier the official, the 
greater the prestige to the state. Besides, what would you know about it? This 
conversation’s beginning to weary me. You signing it or what?” 

The rain hammered on the roof. It was pouring down outside. But the thunder 
had stopped; the storm had moved away. 



INTFRIUDF 


Two days later 

“Do come closer, madam.” Belohun, King of Kerack, beckoned imperiously. 
“Do come closer. Servants! A chair!” 

The chamber’s vaulting was decorated with a plafond of a fresco depicting a 
sailing ship at sea, amidst mermen, hippocampi and lobster-like creatures. The 
fresco on one of the walls, however, was a map of the world. An absolutely 
fanciful map, as Coral had long before realised, having little in common with the 
actual locations of lands and seas, but pleasing and tasteful. 

Two pages lugged in and set down a heavy, carved curule seat. The sorceress 
sat down, resting her hands on the armrests so that her ruby-encrusted bracelets 
would be very conspicuous and not escape the king’s attention. She had a small 
mby tiara on her coiffed hair, and a ruby necklace in the plunging neckline of 
her dress. All especially for the royal audience. She wanted to make an 
impression. And had. King Belohun stared goggle-eyed: though it wasn’t clear 
whether at the rubies or the cleavage. 

Belohun, son of Osmyk, was, it could be said, a first-generation king. His 
father had made quite a considerable fortune from maritime trade, and probably 
also a little from buccaneering. Having finished off the competition and 
monopolised the region’s cabotage, Osmyk named himself king. That act of self- 
anointed coronation had actually only formalised the status quo, and hence did 
not arouse significant quibbles nor provoke protests. Over the course of various 
private wars and skirmishes, Osmyk had smoothed over border disputes and 
jurisdictional squabbles with his neighbours, Verden and Cidaris. It was 
established where Kerack began, where it finished and who ruled there. And 
since he ruled, he was king—and deserved the title. By the natural order of 
things titles and power pass from father to son, so no one was surprised when 
Belohun ascended his father’s throne, following Osmyk’s death. Osmyk 
admittedly had more sons—at least four of them—but they had all renounced 
their rights to the crown, one of them allegedly even of his own free will. Thus, 



Belohun had reigned in Kerack for over twenty years, deriving profits from 
shipbuilding, freight, fishery and piracy in keeping with family traditions. 

And now King Belohun, seated on a raised throne, wearing a sable calpac 
and with a sceptre in one hand, was granting an audience. As majestic as a dung 
beetle on a cowpat. 

“Our dear Madam Lytta Neyd,” he greeted her. “Our favourite sorceress, 
Lytta Neyd. She has deigned to visit Kerack again. And surely for a long stay 
again?” 

“The sea air’s good for me.” Coral crossed her legs provocatively, displaying 
a bootee with fashionable cork heels. “With the gracious permission of Your 
Royal Highness.” 

The king glanced at his sons sitting beside him. Both were tall and slender, 
quite unlike their father, who was bony and sinewy, but of not very imposing 
height. Neither did they look like brothers. The older, Egmund, had raven-black 
hair, while Xander, who was a little younger, was almost albino blond. Both 
looked at Lytta with dislike. They were evidently annoyed by the privilege that 
permitted sorceresses to sit in the presence of kings, and that such seated 
audiences were granted to them. The privilege was well established, however, 
and could not be flouted by anyone wanting to be regarded as civilised. And 
Belohun’s sons very much wanted to be regarded as civilised. 

“We graciously grant our permission,” Belohun said slowly. “With one 
proviso.” 

Coral raised a hand and ostentatiously examined her fingernails. It was meant 
to signal that she couldn’t give a shit about Belohun’s proviso. The king didn’t 
decode the signal. Or if he did he concealed it skilfully. 

“It has reached our ears,” he puffed angrily, “that the Honourable Madam 
Neyd makes magical concoctions available to womenfolk who don’t want 
children. And helps those who are already pregnant to abort the foetus. We, here 
in Kerack, consider such a practice immoral.” 

“What a woman has a natural right to,” replied Coral, dryly, “cannot —ipso 
facto —be immoral.” 

“A woman—” the king straightened up his skinny frame on the throne “—has 
the right to expect only two gifts from a man: a child in the summer and thin bast 
slippers in the winter. Both the former and the latter gifts are intended to keep 
the woman at home, since the home is the proper place for a woman—ascribed 
to her by nature. A woman with a swollen belly and offspring clinging to her 
frock will not stray from the home and no foolish ideas will occur to her, which 



guarantees her man peace of mind. A man with peace of mind can labour hard 
for the purpose of increasing the wealth and prosperity of his king. Neither do 
any foolish ideas occur to a man confident of his marriage while toiling by the 
sweat of his brow and with his nose to the grindstone. But if someone tells a 
woman she can have a child when she wants and when she doesn’t she mustn’t, 
and when to cap it all someone offers a method and passes her a physick, then, 
Honourable Lady, then the social order begins to totter.” 

“That’s right,” interjected Prince Xander, who had been waiting for some 
time for a chance to interject. “Precisely!” 

“A woman who is averse to motherhood,” continued Belohun, “a woman 
whose belly, the cradle and a host of brats don’t imprison her in the homestead, 
soon yields to carnal urges. The matter is, indeed, obvious and inevitable. Then a 
man loses his inner calm and balanced state of mind, something suddenly goes 
out of kilter and stinks in his former harmony, nay, it turns out that there is no 
harmony or order. In particular, there is none of the order that justifies the daily 
grind. And the tmth is I appropriate the results of that hard work. And from such 
thoughts it’s but a single step to upheaval. To sedition, rebellion, revolt. Do you 
see, Neyd? Whoever gives womenfolk contraceptive agents or enables 
pregnancies to be terminated undermines the social order and incites riots and 
rebellion.” 

“That is so,” interjected Xander. “Absolutely!” 

Lytta didn’t care about Belohun’s outer trappings of authority and 
imperiousness. She knew perfectly well that as a sorceress she was immune and 
that all the king could do was talk. However, she refrained from bluntly bringing 
to his attention that things had been out of kilter and stinking in his kingdom for 
ages, that there was next to no order in it, and that the only “Harmony” known to 
his subjects was a harlot of the same name at the portside brothel. And mixing 
up in it women and motherhood—or aversion to motherhood—was evidence not 
only of misogyny, but also imbecility. 

Instead of that she said the following: “In your lengthy disquisition you keep 
stubbornly returning to the themes of increasing wealth and prosperity. I 
understand you perfectly, since my own prosperity is also extremely dear to me. 
And not for all the world would I give up anything that prosperity provides me 
with. I judge that a woman has the right to have children when she wants and not 
to have them when she doesn’t, but I shall not enter into a debate in that regard; 
after all, everyone has the right to some opinion or other. I merely point out that 
I charge a fee for the medical help I give women. It’s quite a significant source 



of my income. We have a free market economy, Your Majesty. Please don’t 
interfere with the sources of my income. Because my income, as you well know, 
is also the income of the Chapter and the entire consorority. And the consorority 
reacts extremely badly to any attempts to diminish its income.” 

“Are you trying to threaten me, Neyd?” 

“The very thought! Not only am I not, but I declare my far-reaching help and 
collaboration. Know this, Belohun, that if—as a result of the exploitation and 
plunder you’re engaged in—unrest occurs in Kerack, if—speaking 
grandiloquently—the fire of rebellion flares up, or if a rebellious rabble comes to 
drag you out by the balls, dethrone you and hang you forthwith from a dry 
branch ... Then you’ll be able to count on my consorority. And the sorcerers. 
We’ll come to your aid. We shan’t allow revolt or anarchy, because they don’t 
suit us either. So keep on exploiting and increasing your wealth. Feel free. And 
don’t interfere with others doing the same. That’s my request and advice.” 

“Advice?” fumed Xander, rising from his seat. “You, advising? My father? 
My father is the king! Kings don’t listen to advice—kings command!” 

“Sit down and be quiet, son.” Belohun grimaced, “And you, witch, listen 
carefully. I have something to say to you.” 

“Yes?” 

“I’m taking a new lady wife ... Seventeen years old ... A little cherry, I tell 
you. A cherry on a tart.” 

“My congratulations.” 

“I’m doing it for dynastic reasons. Out of concern for the succession and 
order in the land.” 

Egmund, previously silent as the grave, jerked his head up. 

“Succession?” he snarled, and the evil glint in his eyes didn’t escape Lytta’s 
notice. “What succession? You have six sons and eight daughters, including 
bastards! What more do you want?” 

“You can see for yourself.” Belohun waved a bony hand. “You can see for 
yourself, Neyd. I have to look after the succession. Am I to leave the kingdom 
and the crown to someone who addresses his parent thus? Fortunately, I’m still 
alive and reigning. And I mean to reign for a long time. As I said, I’m wedding 

“What of it?” 

“Were she ...” The king scratched behind an ear and glanced at Lytta from 
under half-closed eyelids. “Were she ... I mean my new, young wife ... to ask 
you for those physicks ... I forbid you from giving them. Because I’m against 



physicks like that. Because they’re immoral!” 

“We can agree on that.” Coral smiled charmingly. “If your little cherry asks I 
won’t give her anything. I promise.” 

“I understand.” Belohun brightened up. “Why, how splendidly we’ve come 
to agreement. The crux is mutual understanding and respect. One must even 
differ with grace.” 

“That’s right,” interjected Xander. Egmund bristled and swore under his 
breath. 

“In the spirit of respect and understanding—” Coral twisted a ginger ringlet 
around a finger and looked up at the plafond “—and also out of concern for 
harmony and order in your country ... I have some information. Confidential 
information. I consider informants repellent; but fraudsters and thieves even 
more so. And this concerns impudent embezzlement, Your Majesty. People are 
trying to rob you.” 

Belohun leaned forward from his throne, grimacing like a wolf. 

“Who? I want names!” 



Kerack, a city in the northern kingdom of Cidaris, at the mouth of the 
River Adalatte. Once the capital of the independent kingdom ofK., which, 
as the result of inept governments and the extinction of the royal line, fell 
into decline, lost its significance and became parcelled up by its 
neighbours and incorporated into them. It has a port, several factories, a 
lighthouse and roughly two thousand residents. 

Effenberg and Talbot, Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi, vol. VIII 



CHAPTER TWO 


The bay bristled with masts and filled with sails, some white, some many- 
coloured. The larger ships stood at anchor, protected by a headland and a 
breakwater. In the port itself, smaller and absolutely tiny vessels were moored 
alongside wooden jetties. Almost all of the free space on the beach was occupied 
by boats. Or the remains of boats. 

A white-and-red-brick lighthouse, originally built by the elves and later 
renovated, stood tall at the end of the headland where it was being buffeted by 
white breakers. 

The Witcher spurred his mare in her sides. Roach raised her head and flared 
her nostrils as though also enjoying the smell of the sea breeze. Urged on, she set 
off across the dunes. Towards the city, now nearby. 

The city of Kerack, the chief metropolis of the kingdom bearing the same 
name, was divided into three separate, distinct zones straddling both banks at the 
mouth of the River Adalatte. 

The port complex with docks and an industrial and commercial centre, 
including a shipyard and workshops as well as food-processing plants, 
warehouses and stores was located on the left bank of the Adalatte. 

The river’s right bank, an area called Palmyra, was occupied by the shacks 
and cottages of labourers and paupers, the houses and stalls of small traders, 
abattoirs and shambles, and numerous bars and dens that only livened up after 
nightfall, since Palmyra was also the district of entertainment and forbidden 
pleasures. It was also quite easy, as Geralt knew well, to lose one’s purse or get a 
knife in the ribs there. 

Kerack proper, an area consisting of narrow streets running between the 
houses of wealthy merchants and financiers, manufactories, banks, pawnbrokers, 
shoemakers’ and tailors’ shops, and large and small stores, was situated further 
away from the sea, on the left bank, behind a high palisade of robust stakes. 
Located there were also taverns, coffee houses and inns of superior category, 
including establishments offering, indeed, much the same as the port quarter of 
Palmyra, but at considerably higher prices. The centre of the district was a 



quadrangular town square featuring the town hall, the theatre, the courthouse, the 
customs office and the houses of the city’s elite. A statue of the city’s founder, 
King Osmyk, dreadfully spattered in bird droppings, stood on a plinth in the 
middle of the town square. It was a downright lie, as a seaside town had existed 
there long before Osmyk arrived from the devil knows where. 

Higher up, on a hill, stood the castle and the royal palace, which were quite 
unusual in terms of form and shape. It had previously been a temple, which was 
abandoned by its priests embittered by the townspeople’s total lack of interest 
and then modified and extended. The temple’s campanile—or bell tower—and 
its bell had even survived, which the incumbent King Belohun ordered to be 
tolled every day at noon and—clearly just to spite his subjects—at midnight. The 
bell sounded as the Witcher began to ride between Palmyra’s cottages. 

Palmyra stank of fish, laundry and cheap restaurants, and the crush in the 
streets was dreadful, which cost the Witcher a great deal of time and patience to 
negotiate the streets. He breathed a sigh when he finally arrived at the bridge and 
crossed onto the Adalatte’s left bank. The water smelled foul and bore scuds of 
dense foam—waste from the tannery located upstream. From that point it wasn’t 
far to the road leading to the palisaded city. 

Geralt left his horse in the stables outside the city centre, paying for two days 
in advance and giving the stableman some baksheesh in order to ensure that 
Roach was adequately cared for. He headed towards the watchtower. One could 
only enter Kerack through the watchtower, after undergoing a search and the 
rather unpleasant procedures accompanying it. This necessity somewhat angered 
the Witcher, but he understood its purpose—the fancier townspeople weren’t 
especially overjoyed at the thought of visits by guests from dockside Palmyra, 
particularly in the form of mariners from foreign parts putting ashore there. 

He entered the watchtower, a log building that he knew accommodated the 
guardhouse. He thought he knew what to expect. He was wrong. 

He had visited numerous guardhouses in his life: small, medium and large, 
both nearby and in quite distant parts of the world, some in more and less 
civilised—and some quite uncivilised—regions. All the world’s guardhouses 
stank of mould, sweat, leather and urine, as well as iron and the grease used to 
preserve it. It was no different in the Kerack guardhouse. Or it wouldn’t have 
been, had the classic guardhouse smell not been drowned out by the heavy, 
choking, floor-to-ceiling odour of farts. There could be no doubt that leguminous 
plants—most likely peas and beans—prevailed in the diet of the guardhouse’s 


crew. 



And the garrison was wholly female. It consisted of six women currently 
sitting at a table and busy with their midday meal. They were all greedily 
slurping some morsels floating in a thin paprika sauce from earthenware bowls. 

The tallest guard, clearly the commandant, pushed her bowl away and stood 
up. Geralt, who always maintained there was no such thing as an ugly woman, 
suddenly felt compelled to revise this opinion. 

“Weapons on the bench!” 

The commandant’s head—like those of her comrades—was shaven. Her hair 
had managed to grow back a little, giving rise to patchy stubble on her bald 
head. The muscles of her midriff showed from beneath her unbuttoned waistcoat 
and gaping shirt, bringing to mind a netted pork roast. The guard’s biceps—to 
remain on the subject of cooked meat—were the size of hams. 

“Put your weapons on the bench!” she repeated. “You deaf?” 

One of her subordinates, still hunched over her bowl, raised herself a little 
and farted, loud and long. Her companions guffawed. Geralt fanned himself with 
a glove. The guard looked at his swords. 

“Hey, girls! Get over here!” 

The “girls” stood up rather reluctantly, stretching. Their style of clothing, 
Geralt noticed, was quite informal, mainly intended to show off their 
musculature. One of them was wearing leather shorts with the legs split at the 
seams to accommodate her thighs. Two belts crossing her chest were pretty 
much all she had on above the waist. 

“A witcher,” she stated. “Two swords. Steel and silver.” 

Another—like all of them, tall and broad-shouldered—approached, tugged 
open Geralt’s shirt unceremoniously and pulled out his medallion by the silver 
chain. 

“He has a sign,” she stated. “There’s a wolf on it, fangs bared. Would seem 
to be a witcher. Do we let him through?” 

“Rules don’t prohibit it. He’s handed over his swords ...” 

“That’s correct,” Geralt joined the conversation in a calm voice. “I have. 
They’ll both remain, I presume, in safe deposit? To be reclaimed on production 
of a docket. Which you’re about to give me?” 

The guards surrounded him, grinning. One of them prodded him, apparently 
by accident. Another farted thunderously. 

“That’s your receipt,” she snorted. 

“A witcher! A hired monster killer! And he gave up his swords! At once! 
Meek as a schoolboy!” 



“Bet he’d turn his cock over as well, if we ordered him to.” 

“Let’s do it then! Eh, girls? Have him whip it out!” 

“We’ll see what witchers’ cocks are like!” 

“Here we go,” snapped the commandant. “They’re off now, the sluts. 
Gonschorek, get here! Gonschorek!” 

A balding, elderly gentleman in a dun mantle and woollen beret emerged 
from the next room. Immediately he entered he had a coughing fit, took off his 
beret and began to fan himself with it. He took the swords wrapped in their belts 
and gestured for Geralt to follow him. The Witcher didn’t linger. Intestinal gases 
had definitely begun to predominate in the noxious mixture of the guardhouse. 

The room they entered was split down the middle by a sturdy iron grating. 
The large key the elderly gentleman opened it with grated in the lock. He hung 
the swords on a hook beside other sabres, claymores, broadswords and cutlasses. 
He opened a scruffy register, scrawled slowly and lengthily in it, coughing 
incessantly and struggling to catch his breath. He finally handed Geralt the 
completed receipt. 

“Am I to understand that my swords are safe here? Locked away and under 
guard?” 

The dun-clad elderly gentleman, puffing and panting heavily, locked the 
grating and showed him the key. It didn’t convince Geralt. Any grating could be 
forced, and the noisy flatulence of the “ladies” from the guardhouse was capable 
of drowning out any attempts at burglary. But there was no choice. He had to 
accomplish in Kerack what he had come to do. And leave the city as soon as he 
could. 


*■ 


The tavern—or, as the sign declared, the Natura Rerum osteria—was a small but 
tasteful building of cedar wood, with a steep roof and a chimney sticking up high 
out of it. The building’s facade was decorated by a porch with steps leading to it, 
surrounded by spreading aloe plants in wooden tubs. The smell of cooking— 
mainly meat roasting on a gridiron—drifted from the tavern. The scents were so 
enticing that right away it seemed to the Witcher that Natura Rerum was an 
Eden, a garden of delights, an island of happiness, a retreat for the blessed 
flowing with milk and honey. 

It soon turned out that this Eden—like every Eden—was guarded. It had its 
own Cerberus, a guard with a flaming sword. Geralt had the chance to see him in 



action. Before his very eyes, the guard, a short but powerfully built fellow, was 
driving a skinny young man from the garden of delights. The young man was 
protesting—shouting and gesticulating—which clearly annoyed the guard. 

“You’re barred, Muus. As well you know. So be off. I won’t say it again.” 

The young man moved away from the steps quickly enough to avoid being 
pushed. He was, Geralt noticed, prematurely balding, his long, thin hair only 
beginning somewhere in the region of his crown, which gave a generally rather 
unprepossessing impression. 

“Fuck you and your ban!” yelled the young man from a safe distance. “I 
don’t need any favours! You aren’t the only ones! I’ll go to the competition! 
Big-heads! Upstarts! The sign may be gilded, but there’s still dung on your 
boots. You mean as much to me as that dung. And shit will always be shit!” 

Geralt was slightly worried. The balding young man, apart from his unsightly 
looks, was dressed in quite a grand fashion, perhaps not too richly, but in any 
case, more elegantly than the Witcher. So, if elegance was the determining 
criterion ... 

“And where might you be going, may I ask?” The guard’s icy voice 
interrupted his train of thought. And confirmed his fears. 

“This is an exclusive tavern,” continued the Cerberus, blocking the stairs. 
“Do you understand the meaning of the word? It’s off limits, as it were. To some 
people.” 

“Why to me?” 

“Don’t judge a book by its cover.” The guard looked down on the Witcher 
from two steps higher up. “You are a foreigner, a walking illustration of that old 
folk saying. Your cover is nothing to write home about. Perhaps there are other 
objects hidden in its pages, but I shan’t pry. I repeat, this is an exclusive tavern. 
We don’t tolerate people dressed like ruffians here. Or armed.” 

“I’m not armed.” 

“But you look like you are. So kindly take yourself off somewhere else.” 

“Control yourself, Tarp.” 

A swarthy man in a short velvet jacket appeared in the doorway of the tavern. 
His eyebrows were bushy, his gaze piercing and his nose aquiline. And large. 

“You clearly don’t know who you’re dealing with,” the aquiline nose 
informed the guard. “You don’t know who has come to visit.” 

The guard’s lengthening silence showed he indeed did not. 

“Geralt of Rivia. The Witcher. Known for protecting people and saving their 
lives. As he did a week ago, here, in our region, in Ansegis, when he saved a 



mother and her child. And several months earlier, he famously killed a man- 
eating leucrote in Cizmar, suffering wounds in so doing. How could you bar 
entry to my tavern to somebody who plies such an honest trade? On the contrary, 
I’m very happy to see a guest like him. And I consider it an honour that he 
desires to visit me. Master Geralt, the Natura Rerum osteria warmly welcomes 
you. I’m Febus Ravenga, the owner of this humble house.” 

The table that the head waiter sat him at had a tablecloth. All the tables in the 
Natura Rerum—most of which were occupied—had tablecloths. Geralt couldn’t 
recall the last time he’d seen any in a tavern. 

Although curious, he didn’t look around, not wanting to appear provincial 
and uncouth. However, a cautious glance revealed modest—though elegant and 
tasteful—decor. The clientele, whom he judged to be mainly merchants and 
craftsmen, were also elegantly—although not always tastefully—attired. There 
were ships’ captains, weather-beaten and bearded. And there was no shortage of 
garishly dressed noblemen. It smelled nice and elegant: of roast meat, garlic, 
caraway and big money. 

He felt eyes on him. His witcher senses immediately signalled whenever he 
was being observed. He had a quick, discreet look around. 

A young woman with fox-red hair was observing him, also very discreetly, 
and to an ordinary mortal imperceptibly. She was pretending to be completely 
absorbed in her meal—something tasty looking and temptingly fragrant even 
from a distance. Her style and body language left no doubt. Not to a witcher. He 
would have bet anything she was a sorceress. 

The head waiter shook him out of his contemplation and sudden nostalgia. 

“Today,” he announced ceremonially and not without pride, “we propose 
veal shank stewed in vegetables with mushrooms and beans. Saddle of lamb 
roast with aubergines. Bacon in beer served with glazed plums. Roast shoulder 
of boar, served with stewed apples. Fried duck breasts, served with red cabbage 
and cranberries. Squid stuffed with chicory in a white sauce served with grapes. 
Grilled monkfish in a cream sauce, served with stewed pears. Or as usual, our 
speciality: goose legs in white wine, with a choice of baked fruit, and turbot in 
caramelised cuttlefish ink, served with crayfish necks.” 

“If you have a liking for fish,” Febus Ravenga suddenly appeared at the table 
out of the blue, “I heartily recommend the turbot. From the morning catch, it 
goes without saying. The pride and boast of our head chef.” 

“The turbot in ink then.” The Witcher fought against an irrational desire to 
order several dishes in one go, aware it would have been in bad taste. “Thank 



you for the suggestion. I’d begun to suffer the agony of choice.” 

“Which wine,” the head waiter asked, “would sir like to order?” 

“Please choose something suitable. I’m not very au fait with wines.” 

“Few are,” smiled Febus Ravenga. “And very few admit it. Never fear, we 
shall choose the type and vintage, Master Witcher. I’ll leave you in peace, bon 
appetit.” 

That wish was not to come true. Neither did Geralt have the opportunity to 
find out what wine they would choose. The taste of turbot in cuttlefish ink was 
also to remain a mystery to him that day. 

The red-haired woman suddenly abandoned discretion, as her eyes found his. 
She smiled. Spitefully, he couldn’t help feeling. He felt a quiver run through 
him. 

“The Witcher called Geralt of Rivia?” The question was asked by one of 
three characters dressed in black who had noiselessly approached the table. 

“It is I.” 

“You are arrested in the name of the law.” 



What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? 


William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice 



CHAPTER THRF.F. 


Geralt’s court-appointed barrister avoided eye contact. She flicked through the 
portfolio of documents with a persistence worthy of a better cause. There were 
very few papers in it. Two, to be precise. His lawyer had probably learned them 
by heart. To dazzle them with her speech for the defence, he hoped. But that 
was, he suspected, a forlorn hope. 

“You assaulted two of your cellmates while under arrest.” His lawyer finally 
raised her eyes. “Ought I perhaps to know the reason?” 

“Primo, I rejected their sexual advances. They didn’t want to understand that 
‘no’ means ‘no.’ Secundo, I like beating people up. Tertio, it’s a falsehood. They 
self-inflicted their wounds. By banging themselves against the wall. To slander 
me.” 

He spoke slowly and carelessly. After a week spent in prison he had become 
utterly indifferent. 

His barrister closed the portfolio. Only to open it again straight away. Then 
she tidied her elaborate coiffure. 

“The victims aren’t pressing charges, it transpires.” She sighed. “Let us focus 
on the prosecutor’s charge. The tribunal assessor is accusing you of a grave 
crime, punishable by a severe penalty.” 

How could it be otherwise? he thought, contemplating the lawyer’s features. 
He wondered how old she had been when she entered the school for sorcerers. 
And how old she was when she left. 

The two schools for sorcerers—Ban Ard School for boys and Aretuza School 
for girls, both on the Isle of Thanedd—apart from male and female graduates, 
also produced rejects. In spite of the strict selection procedure of their entry 
examinations, which was supposed to facilitate the winnowing out and 
discarding of hopeless cases, it was only the first semesters that really found and 
revealed the ones who had managed to remain hidden. The ones for whom 
thinking turned out to be a disagreeable and hazardous experience. Latent idiots, 
sluggards and intellectual slackers of both sexes, who had no place in schools of 
magic. The difficulty was that they were usually the offspring of wealthy people 



or considered important for other reasons. After being expelled from school it 
was necessary to do something with these difficult youngsters. There was no 
problem for the boys rejected by Ban Ard—they joined the diplomatic service, 
the army, navy or police while politics was left for the stupidest. Magical rejects 
in the shape of the fairer sex seemed to be more difficult to place. Although 
expelled, the young ladies had nonetheless crossed the threshold of a school of 
magic and had tasted magic to some degree or other. And the influence of 
sorceresses on monarchs, and on all areas of political and economic life, was too 
powerful for the young ladies to be left in the lurch. They were provided with a 
safe haven. They joined the judiciary. They became lawyers. 

The defence counsel closed the portfolio. Then opened it. 

“I recommend an admission of guilt,” she said. “Then we can expect a more 
lenient punishment—” 

“Admit to what?” interrupted the Witcher. 

“When the judge asks if you plead guilty you are to reply in the affirmative. 
An admission of guilt will be regarded as a mitigating circumstance.” 

“How do you mean to defend me, then?” 

The lawyer closed the portfolio. As though it were a coffin lid. 

“Let’s go. The judge is waiting.” 

The judge was waiting. For right then the previous miscreant was being 
escorted from the courtroom. He looks none too cheerful, thought Geralt. 

A shield flecked with flies bearing the emblem of Kerack, a blue dolphin 
naiant, hung on the wall. Under the coat of arms was the bench, with three 
people sitting behind it. A scrawny scribe. A faded subjudge. And the judge, a 
woman of equable appearance and countenance. 

The bench on the judges’ right was occupied by the tribunal assessor, acting 
as prosecutor. He looked serious. Serious enough to avoid an encounter with him 
in a dark alley. 

On the other side, on the judges’ left, was the dock. The place assigned to 
Geralt. 

Things moved quickly after that. 

“Geralt, called Geralt of Rivia, a witcher by profession, is accused of 
embezzlement, of the seizure and misappropriation of Crown property. Acting in 
league with other persons whom he corrupted, the accused inflated the fees on 
the bills issued for his services with the intention of arrogating those surpluses. 
Which resulted in losses to the state treasury. The proof is a report, notitia 
criminis, that the prosecution has enclosed in the file. That report...” 



The judge’s weary expression and absent gaze clearly showed that this 
respectable lady was miles away. And that quite other matters and problems 
were distressing her: the laundry, the children, the colour of the curtains, 
preparing the dough for a poppy-seed cake and the stretch marks on her large 
behind auguring a marital crisis. The Witcher humbly accepted the fact that he 
was less important. That he could not compete with anything of that kind. 

“The crime committed by the accused,” the prosecutor continued without 
emotion, “not only damages the country, but also undermines the social order 
and spreads dissent. The law demands—” 

“The report included in the file,” interrupted the judge, “has to be treated by 
the court as probatio de relato, evidence supplied by a third party. Can the 
prosecution supply any other proof?” 

“There is no other evidence ... For the moment ... The accused is, as has 
been pointed out, a witcher. He is a mutant, beyond the margins of human 
society, flouting human laws and placing himself above them. In his 
criminogenic and antisocial profession, he communes with criminals, as well as 
non-humans, including races traditionally hostile to humanity. Law-breaking is 
part of a witcher’s nihilistic nature. In the case of this witcher, Your Honour, the 
lack of evidence is the best proof ... It proves perfidy and—” 

“Does the accused ...” The judge was clearly uninterested in whatever the 
lack of evidence proved. “Does the accused plead guilty?” 

“He does not.” Geralt ignored his lawyer’s desperate signals. “I am innocent; 
I haven’t committed any crime.” 

He had some skill, he had dealt with the law. He had also familiarised 
himself with the literature on the subject. 

“I am accused on the basis of prejudice—” 

“Objection!” yelled the assessor. “The accused is making a speech!” 

“Objection dismissed.” 

“—as a result of prejudice against my person and my profession, i.e. as a 
result of praeiudicium. Praeiudicium implies, in advance, a falsehood. 
Furthermore, I stand accused on the grounds of an anonymous denunciation, and 
only one. Testimonium unius non valet. Testis unus, testis nullus. Ergo, it is not 
an accusation, but conjecture, i.e. praesumptio. And conjecture leaves doubt.” 

“In dubio pro reo\” the defence counsel roused herself. “In dubio pro reo, 
Your Honour!” 

“The court has decided to set bail of five hundred Novigradian crowns.” The 
judge struck her gavel on the bench, waking up the faded subjudge. 



Geralt sighed. He wondered if both his cellmates had come around and drawn 
any kind of lesson from the matter. Or whether he would have to give them 
another hiding. 



What is the city but the people? 


William Shakespeare, Coriolanus 



CHAPTF.R FOUR 


A stall carelessly nailed together from planks, manned by an old dear in a straw 
hat and as plump and ruddy-faced as a good witch from a fairy tale, stood at the 
very edge of the crowded marketplace. The sign above the old dear read: Come 
to me for joy and happiness. Gherkin complimentary. Geralt stopped and dug 
some copper pennies from his pocket. 

“Pour me a gill of happiness, Granny,” he demanded gloomily. 

He took a deep breath, downed it in one, and breathed out. He wiped away 
the tears that the hooch brought to his eyes. 

He was at liberty. And angry. 

He had learned that he was free, interestingly, from a person he knew. By 
sight. It was the same prematurely bald young man who he had observed being 
driven from the steps of the Natura Rerum osteria. And who, it turned out, was 
the court scribe. 

“You’re free,” the bald young man had told him, locking and unlocking his 
thin, ink-stained fingers. “Someone came up with the bail.” 

“Who?” 

The information turned out to be confidential—the bald scribbler refused to 
give it. He also refused—rather bluntly—the return of Geralt’s confiscated 
purse. Which contained cash and bank cheques among other things. The 
Witcher’s personal property—he declared not without spitefulness—had been 
treated by the authorities as a caudo pro expensis, a down payment against court 
costs and expected penalties. 

There was no point or purpose in arguing. On release, Geralt had to content 
himself with what he had in his pockets when he was arrested. Personal trifles 
and petty cash. So petty no one had bothered to steal it. 

He counted the remaining copper pennies and smiled at the old dear. 

“And a gill of joy, please. I’ll decline the gherkin.” 

After the old dear’s hooch, the world took on a more beautiful hue. Geralt 
knew it would quickly pass so he quickened his step. He had things to do. 

Roach, his mare, had fortunately escaped the attentions of the court and 



wasn’t included in the cost of the cautio pro expensis. She was where he’d left 
her, in the stable stall, well-groomed and fed. The Witcher couldn’t accept 
something like that without a reward, irrespective of his own assets. The 
stableman received at once a few of the handful of silver coins that had survived 
in a hiding place sewn into the saddle. Geralt’s generosity took the man’s breath 
away. 

The horizon over the sea was darkening. It seemed to Geralt that he could see 
flashes of lightning there. 

Before entering the guardhouse, he prudently filled his lungs with fresh air. It 
didn’t help. The guardswomen must have eaten more beans than usual that day. 
Many, many more beans. Who knew, perhaps it was Sunday. 

Some of them were eating, as usual. Others were busy playing dice. They 
stood up from the table upon seeing him. And surrounded him. 

“The Witcher, just look,” said the commandant, standing very close, “’e’s up 
and come here.” 

“I’m leaving the city. I’ve come to collect my property.” 

“If we lets you.” Another guard prodded him with an elbow, apparently by 
accident. “What will ’e give us for it? You’ll have to buy yourself out, sonny, 
buy yourself out! Eh, lasses? What’ll we make him do?”

“Kiss all our bare arses!” 

“With a lick! And a dick!” 

“Nothing of the kind! He might infect us with something.” 

“But he’ll ’ave to give some pleasure, won’t ’e?” Another one pushed her 
rock-hard bust onto him. 

“He can sing us an air.” Another one farted thunderously. “And fit the tune to 
my pitch!” 

“Or mine!” Yet another one farted even louder. “Mine’s more full-blooded!” 

The other women laughed so much they clasped their sides. 

Geralt made his way through, trying hard not to use excessive force. At that 
moment, the door to the deposit opened and an elderly gentleman in a grey 
mantle and beret appeared. The attendant, Gonschorek. On seeing the Witcher he 
opened his mouth wide. 

“You, sir?” he mumbled. “How so? Your swords ...” 

“Indeed. My swords. May I have them?” 

“But ... But ...” Gonschorek choked and clutched his chest, struggling to 
catch his breath. “But I don’t have the swords!” 


“I beg your pardon?” 



“I don’t have them ...” Gonschorek’s face flushed. And contorted as though 
in a paroxysm of pain. “Them bin took—” 

“What?” Geralt felt cold fury gripping him. 

“Bin ... took ...” 

“What do you mean, taken?” He grabbed the attendant by the lapels. “Taken 
by whom, dammit? What the bloody hell is this about?” 

“The docket...” 

“Exactly!” He felt an iron grip on his arm. The commandant of the guard 
shoved him away from the choking Gonschorek. 

“Exactly! Show us the docket!” 

The Witcher did not have the docket. The docket from the weapon store had 
been in his purse. The purse the court had confiscated. Against the costs and the 
expected punishments. 

“The docket!” 

“I don’t have it. But—” 

“No docket, no deposit.” The commandant didn’t let him finish. “Swords bin 
took, didn’t you ’ear? You probably took ’em. And now you’re putting on this 
pantomime? Want to con something out of us? Nothing doing. Get out of here.” 

“I’m not leaving until ...” 

The commandant, without loosening her grasp, dragged Geralt away and 
turned him around. To face the door. 

“Fuck off.” 

Geralt shied away from hitting women. He didn’t, however, have any 
reluctance when it came to somebody who had the shoulders of a wrestler, a 
belly like a netted pork roast and calves like a discus thrower, and on top of that 
who farted like a mule. He pushed the commandant away and smashed her hard 
in the jaw. With his favourite right hook. 

The others froze, but only for a second. Even before the commandant had 
tumbled onto the table, splashing beans and paprika sauce around, they were on 
him. He smashed one of them in the nose without thinking, and hit another so 
hard her teeth made a cracking noise. He treated two to the Aard Sign. They flew 
like rag dolls into a stand of halberds, knocking them all over with an 
indescribable crash and clatter. 

He got hit in the ear by the commandant, who was dripping sauce. The other 
guard, the one with the rock-hard bust, seized him from behind in a bear hug. He 
elbowed her so hard she howled. He pushed the commandant onto the table 
again, and whacked her with a haymaker. He thumped the one with the smashed 



nose in the solar plexus and knocked her to the ground, where she vomited 
audibly. Another, stmck in the temple, slammed her head against a post and 
went limp, her eyes immediately misting over. 

But four of them were still on their feet. That marked the end of his 
advantage. He was hit in the back of the head and then in the ear. And after that 
in the lower back. One of them tripped him up and when he fell down two 
dropped on him, pinning him down and pounding him with their fists. The other 
two weighed in with kicks. 

A head-butt in the face took out one of the women lying on him, but the other 
immediately pressed him down. The commandant—he recognised her by the 
sauce dripping from her. She smacked him from above in the teeth. He spat 
blood right in her eyes. 

“A knife!” she yelled, thrashing her shaven head around. “Give me a knife! 
I’ll cut his balls off!” 

“Why a knife?” yelled another. “I’ll bite them off!” 

“Stop! Attention! What is the meaning of this? Attention, I said!” 

A stentorian voice, commanding respect, tore through the hubbub of the 
fracas, pacifying the guards. They released Geralt from their grasp. He got up 
with difficulty, somewhat sore. The sight of the battlefield improved his humour 
a little. He observed his accomplishments with some satisfaction. The guard 
lying by the wall had opened her eyes, but was still unable even to sit upright. 
Another, bent over, was spitting blood and feeling her teeth with a finger. Yet 
another, the one with the smashed nose, was trying hard to stand, but kept falling 
over, slipping in a puddle of her own beany vomit. Only three of the six could 
keep their balance. So he could be satisfied with the result. Despite the fact that 
had it not been for the intervention he would have suffered more serious injuries 
and might not have been able to get up unaided. 

The person who had intervened, however, was an elegantly attired man with 
noble features, emanating authority. Geralt didn’t know who he was. But he 
knew perfectly well who the noble-looking man’s companion was. A dandy in a 
fanciful hat with an egret feather stuck into it, with shoulder-length blond hair 
curled with irons. Wearing a doublet the colour of red wine and a shirt with a 
lace ruffle. Along with his ever-present lute and with that ever-present insolent 
smile on his lips. 

“Greetings, Witcher! What do you look like? With that smashed-up fizzog! 
I’ll split my sides laughing!” 

“Greetings, Dandelion. I’m pleased to see you too.” 



“What’s going on here?” The man with the noble looks stood with arms 
akimbo. “Well? What are you up to? Standard report! This moment!” 

“It was him!” The commandant shook the last of the sauce from her ears and 
pointed accusingly at Geralt. “He’s guilty, Honourable Instigator. He lost his 
temper and stirred up a row, and then began brawling. And all because of some 
swords in the deposit, what he hasn’t got a docket for. Gonschorek will confirm 
... Hey, Gonschorek, what are you doing curled up in the corner? Shat yourself? 
Move your arse, get up, tell the Honourable Instigator ... Hey! Gonschorek? 
What ails you?” 

A close look was enough to guess what ailed him. There was no need to 
check his pulse, it sufficed to look at his chalky white face. Gonschorek was 
dead. He was, quite simply, deceased. 


* 


“We will institute an investigation, Lord Rivia,” said Ferrant de Lettenhove, 
instigator of the Royal Tribunal. “Since you are lodging a formal complaint and 
appeal we must institute one—the law so decrees. We shall interrogate everyone 
who during your arrest and trial had access to your effects. We shall arrest any 
suspects.” 

“The usual ones?” 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“Nothing, nothing.” 

“Indeed. The matter will certainly be explained, and those guilty of the theft 
of the swords will be brought to justice. If a theft was really committed. I 
promise that we shall solve the mystery and the truth will out. Sooner or later.” 

“I’d rather it were sooner.” The Witcher didn’t care too much for the 
instigator’s tone of voice. “My swords are my existence; I can’t do my job 
without them. I know my profession is adversely perceived by many and that I 
suffer as a result of this negative portrayal caused by prejudice, superstition and 
xenophobia. I hope that fact won’t influence the investigation.” 

“It won’t,” replied Ferrant de Lettenhove dryly, “since law and order prevail 
here.” 

After the servants had carried Gonschorek’s body out, the instigator ordered a 
search of the weapon store and the entire cubbyhole. Predictably, there wasn’t a 
trace of the Witcher’s swords. And the commandant of the guard—still annoyed 
with Geralt—pointed out to them a filing spike where the deceased had kept the 



completed deposit slips. The Witcher’s was soon found among them. The 
commandant searched through the stack, thrusting it under his nose a moment 
later. 

“There you go.” She pointed triumphantly. “It’s here in black and white. 
Signed Gerland of Ryblia. Told yer the witcher had bin here and took his swords 
away. And now ’e’s lying, no doubt to claim damages. Gonschorek turned ’is 
toes up thanks to ’im! His gall bladder ruptured from the worry and ’is heart gev 
out.” 

But neither she, nor any of the other guards, elected to testify that any of 
them had actually seen Geralt collect his weapons. The explanation was that 
“there’s always someone ’anging around ’ere” and they had been busy eating. 

Seagulls circled over the roof of the court, uttering ear-splitting screeches. 
The wind had blown the storm cloud southwards over the sea. The sun was out. 

“May I warn you in advance,” said Geralt, “that my swords are protected by 
powerful spells. Only witchers can touch them; others will have their vitality 
drained away. It mainly manifests in the loss of male potency. I’m talking about 
sexual enfeeblement. Absolute and permanent.” 

“We shall bear that in mind.” The instigator nodded. “For the moment, 
though, I would ask you not to leave the city. I’m inclined to turn a blind eye to 
the brawl in the guardhouse—in any case, they occur there regularly. The guards 
are pretty volatile. And because Julian—I mean Lord Dandelion—vouches for 
you, I’m certain that your case will be satisfactorily solved in court.” 

“My case—” the Witcher squinted his eyes “—is nothing but harassment. 
Intimidation resulting from prejudice and hatred—” 

“The evidence will be examined—” the instigator cut him off “—and 
measures taken based on it. That is what law and order decrees. The same law 
and order that granted you your liberty. On bail, and thus conditionally. You 
ought, Lord Rivia, to respect those caveats.” 

“Who paid the bail?” 

Ferrant de Lettenhove coldly declined to reveal the identity of the Witcher’s 
benefactor, bade farewell and headed towards the entrance to the court, 
accompanied by his servants. It was just what Dandelion had been waiting for. 
Scarcely had they exited the town square and entered a narrow street than he 
revealed everything he knew. 

“It’s a genuine catalogue of unfortunate coincidences, Geralt, my dear. And 
unlucky incidents. And as far as the bail is concerned, it was paid for you by a 
certain Lytta Neyd, known to her friends as Coral, from the colour of the lipstick 



she uses. She’s a sorceress who works for Belohun, the local kinglet. 
Everybody’s racking their brains wondering why she did it. Because it was none 
other than she who sent you down.” 

“What?” 

“Listen, will you? It was Coral who informed on you. That actually didn’t 
surprise anyone, it’s widely known that sorcerers have it in for you. And then a 
bolt from the blue: the sorceress suddenly pays your bail and gets you out of the 
dungeon where you’d been thrown because of her. The whole city—” 

“Widely known? The whole city? What are you saying, Dandelion?” 

“I’m using metaphors and circumlocution. Don’t pretend you don’t know, 
you know me well enough. Naturally not the 'whole city,’ and only certain well- 
informed people among those close to the crown.” 

“And you’re one of them, I presume?” 

“Correct. Ferrant is my cousin—the son of my father’s brother. I dropped in 
to visit him, as you would a relative. And I found out about your imbroglio. I 
immediately interceded for you, you can’t possibly doubt that. I vouched for 
your honesty. I talked about Yennefer ...” 

“Thank you very much.” 

“Drop the sarcasm. I had to talk about her to help my cousin realise that the 
local witch is maligning and slandering you out of jealousy and envy. That the 
entire accusation is false, that you never stoop to swindle people. As a result of 
my intercession, Ferrant de Lettenhove, the royal instigator, a high-ranking legal 
executive, is now convinced of your innocence—” 

“I didn’t get that impression,” said Geralt. “Quite the opposite. I felt he didn’t 
believe me. Neither in the case of the alleged embezzlement, nor in the case of 
the vanished swords. Did you hear what he said about evidence? Evidence is a 
fetish to him. The denunciation will thus be evidence of the fraud and Gerland of 
Ryblia’s signature on the docket is proof of the hoax involving the theft of the 
swords. Not to mention his expression when he was warning me against leaving 
the city ...” 

“You’re being too hard on him,” pronounced Dandelion. “I know him better 
than you. That fact that I’m vouching for you is worth more than a dozen 
inflated pieces of evidence. And he was right to warn you. Why do you think 
both he and I headed to the guardhouse? To stop you from doing anything 
foolish. Someone, you say, is framing you, fabricating phoney evidence? Then 
don’t hand that someone irrefutable proof. Which is what fleeing would be.” 

“Perhaps you’re right,” agreed Geralt. “But my instinct tells me otherwise. I 



ought to do a runner before they utterly corner me. First arrest, then bail, and 
then right after that the swords ... What next? Dammit, without a sword I feel 
like ... like a snail without a shell.” 

“I think you worry too much. And anyway, the place is full of shops. Forget 
about those swords and buy some more.” 

“And if someone were to steal your lute? Which was acquired, as I recall, in 
quite dramatic circumstances? Wouldn’t you worry? Would you let it slide? And 
buy another in the shop around the corner?” 

Dandelion involuntarily tightened his grip on his lute and his eyes swept 
around anxiously. However, none of the passers-by looked like a potential 
robber, nor displayed an unhealthy interest in his unique instrument. 

“Well, yes,” he sighed. “I understand. Like my lute, your swords are also 
unique and irreplaceable. And what’s more ... What were you saying? 
Enchanted? Triggering magical impotence ... Dammit, Geralt! Now you tell me. 
I mean, I’ve often spent time in your company, I’ve had those swords at arm’s 
length! And sometimes closer! Now everything’s clear, now I get it ... I’ve been 
having certain difficulties lately, dammit...” 

“Relax. That impotence thing was nonsense. I made it up on the spot, hoping 
the rumour would spread. That the thief would take fright...” 

“If he takes fright he’s liable to bury the swords in a muck heap,” the bard 
noted, still slightly pale. “And you’ll never get them back. Better to count on my 
cousin Ferrant. He’s been instigator for years, and has a whole army of sheriffs, 
agents and narks. They’ll find the thief in no time, you’ll see.” 

“If the thief’s still here.” The Witcher ground his teeth. “He might have run 
for it while I was in the slammer. What did you say was the name of that 
sorceress who landed me in this?” 

“Lytta Neyd, nicknamed Coral. I can guess what you’re planning, my friend. 
But I don’t think it’s a good idea. She’s a sorceress. An enchantress and a 
woman in one; in a word, an alien species that doesn’t submit to rational 
understanding, and functions according to mechanisms and principles 
incomprehensible to ordinary men. Why am I telling you this, anyway? You 
know it very well. You have, indeed, very rich experience in this matter ... 
What’s that racket?” 

Aimlessly wandering through the streets, they had ended up in the vicinity of 
a small square resounding with the ceaseless banging of hammers. There was a 
large cooper’s workshop there, it turned out. Cords of seasoned planks were 
piled up evenly beneath an awning by the street. From there, the planks were 



carried by barefoot youngsters to tables where they were attached to special 
trestles and shaped using drawknives. The carved staves went to other craftsmen, 
who finished them on long planing benches, standing astride them up to their 
ankles in shavings. The completed staves ended up in the hands of the coopers, 
who assembled them. Geralt watched for a while as the shape of the barrel 
emerged under the pressure of ingenious vices and clamps tightened by screws. 
Metal hoops hammered onto the staves then created the form of the barrel. 
Vapour from the large coppers where the barrels were being steamed belched 
right out into the street. The smell of wood being toasted in a fire—the barrels 
were being hardened before the next stage in the process—drifted from the 
courtyard into the workshop. 

“Whenever I see a barrel,” Dandelion declared, “I feel like a beer. Let’s go 
around the corner. I know a pleasant inn.” 

“Go by yourself. I’m visiting the sorceress. I think I know which one she is; 
I’ve already seen her. Where will I find her? Don’t make faces, Dandelion. She, 
it would seem, is the original source and cause of my troubles. I’m not going to 
wait for things to develop, I’ll go and ask her directly. I can’t hang around in this 
town. If only for the reason that I’m rather skint.” 

“We shall find a remedy for that,” the troubadour said proudly. “I shall 
support you financially ... Geralt? What’s going on?” 

“Go back to the coopers and bring me a stave.” 

“What?” 

“Fetch me a stave. Quickly.” 

The street had been barred by three powerful-looking bruisers with ugly, 
unshaven and unwashed mugs. One of them, so broad-shouldered he was almost 
square, held a metal-tipped club, as thick as a capstan bar. The second, in a 
sheepskin coat with the fur on the outside, was holding a cleaver and had a 
boarding axe in his belt. The third, as swarthy as a mariner, was armed with a 
long, hideous-looking knife. 

“Hey, you there, Rivian bastard!” began the square-shaped man. “How do 
you feel without any swords on your back? Bare-arsed in the wind, eh?” 

Geralt didn’t join in the discourse. He waited. He heard Dandelion arguing 
with a cooper about a stave. 

“You’re toothless now, you freak, you venomous witcher toad,” continued 
the square-shaped man, clearly the most expert of the three in the oratory arts. 
“No one’s afraid of a reptile without fangs! For it’s nothing but a worm or a 
slimy lamprey. We put filth like that under our boots and crush it to a pulp so it 



won’t dare to come into our towns among decent people no more. You won’t 
foul our streets with your slime, you reptile. Have at him, boys!” 

“Geralt! Catch!” 

He caught the stave Dandelion threw to him, dodged a blow from the club, 
smashed the square-shaped man in the side of the head, spun around and 
slammed it into the elbow of the thug in the sheepskin, who yelled and dropped 
the cleaver. The Witcher hit him behind the knees, knocking him down, and 
then, in passing, struck him on the temple with the stave. Without waiting until 
the thug fell down, or interrupting his own movement, he ducked under the 
square-shaped man’s club and slammed him over the fingers clenched around it. 
The square-shaped man howled in pain and dropped the club, and Geralt struck 
him in turn on the right ear, the ribs and the left ear. And then kicked him hard in 
the crotch. The square-shaped man fell over and rolled into a ball, cringing and 
curling up, his forehead touching the ground. 

The swarthy one, the most agile and quickest of the three, danced around the 
Witcher. Deftly tossing his knife from hand to hand, he attacked on bent legs, 
slashing diagonally. Geralt easily avoided the blows, stepped back and waited 
for him to lengthen his strides. And when that happened he knocked the knife 
away with a sweeping blow of the stave, circled the assailant with a pirouette 
and slammed him in the back of the head. The knifeman fell to his knees and the 
Witcher whacked him in the right kidney. The man howled and tensed up and 
the Witcher bashed him with the stave below the ear, striking a nerve. One 
known to physicians as the parotid plexus. 

“Oh, dear,” said Geralt, standing over the man, who was curled up, retching 
and choking on his screams. “That must have hurt.” 

The thug in the sheepskin coat drew the axe from his belt, but didn’t get up 
from his knees, uncertain what to do. Geralt dispelled his doubts, smashing him 
over the back of the neck with the stave. 

The fellows from the town guard came running along the street, jostling the 
gathering crowd of onlookers. Dandelion pacified them, citing his connections, 
frantically explaining who had been the assailant and who had acted in self- 
defence. The Witcher gestured the bard over. 

“See that the bastards are tied up. Persuade your cousin the instigator to give 
them a hard time. They either had a hand in stealing the swords themselves or 
somebody hired them. They knew I was unarmed, which is why they dared to 
attack. Give the coopers back their stave.” 

“I had to buy it,” admitted Dandelion. “And I think I did the right thing. You 



wield a mean plank, I can see. You should pack one all the time.” 

“I’m going to the sorceress. To pay her a visit. Should I take the stave?” 

“Something heavier would come in useful with a sorceress.” The bard 
grimaced. “A fence post, for example. A philosopher acquaintance of mine used 
to say: when visiting a woman, never forget to take a—” 

“Dandelion.” 

“Very well, very well, I’ll give you directions to the witch. But first, if I 
might advise ...” 

“Yes?” 

“Visit a bathhouse. And a barber.” 



Guard against disappointments, because appearances can deceive. 
Things that are really as they seem are rare. And a woman is never as she 
seems. 

Dandelion, Haifa Century of Poetry 



CHAPTF.R FTVF, 


The water in the fountain swirled and boiled, spraying small golden drops 
around. Lytta Neyd, known as Coral, a sorceress, held out her hand and chanted 
a stabilising charm. The water became as smooth as though oil had been poured 
over it and pulsated with glimmers of light. The image, at first vague and 
nebulous, became sharper and stopped shimmering, and, although slightly 
distorted by the movement of the water, was distinct and clear. Coral leaned 
over. She saw the Spice Market, the city’s main street, in the water. And a white- 
haired man crossing it. The sorceress stared. Observed. Searched for clues. Some 
kind of details. Details that would enable her to make the appropriate evaluation. 
And allow her to predict what would happen. 

Lytta had a tried and tested opinion, formed by years of experience, of what 
constituted a real man. She knew how to recognise a real man in a flock of more- 
or-less successful imitations. In order to do that she did not have to resort to 
physical contact, a method of testing manhood she considered like the majority 
of sorceresses, not just trivial, but also misleading and liable to lead one astray. 
Savouring them directly, as her attempts had proven, was perhaps some kind of 
indication of taste, but all too often left a bitter aftertaste. Indigestion. And 
heartburn. And even vomiting. 

Lytta was able to recognise a real man even at a distance, on the basis of 
trifling and apparently insignificant criteria. A real man, the sorceress knew from 
experience, is an enthusiastic angler, but only using a fly. He collects military 
figures, erotic prints and models of sailing ships he builds himself, including the 
kind in bottles, and there is never a shortage of empty bottles of expensive 
alcoholic drinks in his home. He is an excellent cook, able to conjure up 
veritable culinary masterpieces. And well—when all’s said and done—the very 
sight of him is enough to make one desirous. 

The Witcher Geralt, about whom the sorceress had heard a great deal, about 
whom she had acquired much information, and whom she was right then 
observing in the fountain, met but one of the above conditions, it appeared. 

“Mozai'k!” 



“Yes, madam.” 

“We’re going to have a guest. Everything is to be suitably prepared and 
elegant. But first bring me a gown.” 

“The tea rose? Or the aquamarine?” 

“The white one. He dresses in black, we’ll treat him to yin and yang. And 
sandals, select something matching, make sure they have at least four-inch heels. 
I can’t let him look down on me too much.” 

“Madam ... That white gown ...” 

“Yes?” 

“It’s, well ...” 

“Modest? Without any ornamentation or furbelows? Oh, Mozaik, Mozaik. 
Will you ever learn?”

He was met in the doorway by a burly and pot-bellied bruiser with a broken nose 
and little piggy eyes, who searched Geralt from head to toe and then once again 
the other way. Then he stood back, giving a sign for the Witcher to pass. 

A girl with smoothly combed—almost slicked-down—hair was waiting in 
the anteroom. She invited him in with a gesture, without uttering a single word. 

He entered straight onto a patio dotted with flowers and a splashing fountain 
in the centre. In the middle of the fountain stood a small marble statue portraying 
a naked, dancing girl. Apart from the fact that it was sculpted by a master, the 
statue was conspicuous for another detail—it was attached to the plinth at a 
single point: the big toe of one foot. In no way, judged the Witcher, could the 
construction be stable without the help of magic. 

“Geralt of Rivia. Welcome. Do come in.” 

The sorceress Lytta Neyd was too sharp-featured to be considered classically 
beautiful. The warm peach shade of rouge on her cheekbones softened the 
sharpness but couldn’t hide it. Her lips—highlighted by coral-red lipstick—were 
so perfectly shaped as to be too perfect. But that wasn’t what mattered. 

Lytta Neyd was a redhead. A classic, natural redhead. Her hair’s mellow, 
light russet evoked associations with a fox’s summer coat. If one were to catch a 
red fox and place it alongside her—Geralt was quite convinced about this—the 
two of them would prove to be identically coloured and indistinguishable from 
each other. And when the sorceress moved her head, lighter, yellowish accents 
lit up among the red, identical to a fox’s fur. That type of red hair was usually 



accompanied by freckles—usually in excess. That wasn’t the case with Lytta. 

Geralt felt an anxiety, forgotten and dormant, suddenly awaking somewhere 
deep inside him. He had a strange and inexplicable inclination towards redheads 
in his nature, and several times that particular colouring had made him do stupid 
things. Thus he ought to be on his guard, and the Witcher made a firm resolution 
in that regard. His task was actually made easier. It was almost a year since he’d 
stopped being tempted by that kind of stupid mistake. 

Erotically alluring red hair wasn’t the sorceress’s only attractive attribute. 
Her snow-white dress was modest and utterly without effects, which was the 
aim, the intended aim, and without the slightest doubt deliberate. Its simplicity 
didn’t distract the attention of the observer, but focused it on her attractive 
figure. And the plunging cleavage. To put it concisely, Lytta Neyd could easily 
have posed for an engraving accompanying the chapter “Impure Desire” in the 
illustrated edition of the prophet Lebioda’s Good Book. 

To put it even more concisely, Lytta Neyd was a woman whom only a 
complete idiot would have wanted to have relations with for longer than two 
days. It was curious that women like that were usually pursued by hordes of men 
inclined to stay for much longer. 

She smelled of freesias and apricots. 

Geralt bowed and then pretended the statue in the fountain was more 
interesting than her figure and cleavage. 

“Come in,” repeated Lytta, pointing at a malachite-topped table and two 
wicker armchairs. She waited for him to sit down, then as she was taking her 
place showed off a shapely calf and a lizard skin sandal. The Witcher pretended 
his entire attention was absorbed by the carafes and fruit bowl. 

“Wine? It’s Nuragus from Toussaint, in my opinion more compelling than 
the overrated Est Est. There is also Cote-de-Blessure, if you prefer red. Pour 
please, Mozai'k.” 

“Thank you.” He took a goblet from the girl with the slicked-down hair and 
smiled at her. “Mozai'k. Pretty name.” 

He saw terror in her eyes. 

Lytta Neyd placed her goblet on the table. With a bang, meant to focus his 
attention. 

“What brings the celebrated Geralt of Rivia to my humble abode?” She 
tossed her shock of red curls. “I’m dying to find out.” 

“You bought me out,” he said, deliberately coolly. “Paid my bail, I mean. I 
was released from gaol thanks to your munificence. Where I also ended up 



because of you. Right? Is it because of you I spent a week in a cell?” 

“Four days.” 

“Four days. I’d like to learn, if possible, the motives behind those actions. 
Both of them.” 

“Both?” She raised her eyebrows and her goblet. “There’s one. And only 
one.” 

“Oh.” He pretended to be devoting all his attention to Mozaik, who was 
busying herself on the other side of the patio. “So you informed on me and got 
me thrown into the clink, and then got me out for the same reason?” 

“Bravo.” 

“So, I ask: why?” 

“To show you I can.” 

He took a sip of wine. Which was indeed very good. 

“You proved that you can,” he nodded. “In principle, you could have simply 
told me that, by meeting me in the street, for instance. I would’ve believed it. 
You preferred to do it differently. And forcibly. So, I ask: what now?”
