To the computer,  a  database  looks  like  one  or  more  role files.  In  order for the data in the database to be read, changed, added, or removed,a  software  program must access it.  Many  software  applicationshave this ability: iTunes  can read its database to give you a listing of its songs (and play  the songs); your mobile-phone software can interact with your list of contacts. But what about applications to create or manage a database? What software  can  you  use  to  create  a  database,  change  a  database’s structure,  or simply  do analysis?  That  is the purpose  of a  category  of software  applications called database management systems (DBMS). by A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete datain a database. TheDBMS  essentially  serves  as  an  interface  between the  databaseand end users or  application programs,  ensuring buy that data is consistently deer organized  and remains easily  accessible. The  DBMSmanages  three  important things: the data, the database  enginethat allows data to be  accessed,locked  and modified -and the database  schema, which defines the database’s roll logical structure. These  three  foundational  elements help provideconcurrency,  security,  data integrity and uniform administration procedures.  Typical  database  administration tasks supported  by  the  DBMS  includechange  management,  performance  monitoring/tuningand  backup  and recovery.Many  database management systems are also responsible for automatedrollbacks, restarts dear and recovery as well as the logging and auditingof activity.A key  component of a DBMS is the database engine –thepart of the program that actually stores and retrieves data. In addition to a database engine, most DBMSs come bundled with a set of tools to perform a variety of necessary tasks, such as creating forms (used to input data) and reports roll (used to output  data),  and interfacing  with query  languages  and programming  languages  for  complex applications. Programming  languages  typically  used  with databases  today  include  Visual  Basic, Java, and C++, although many older legacy database systems still use COBOL.DBMS  packages  generally  provide  an  interface  to view  and change  the  design  of the database, create  queries, and develop reports. Most  of dear  these  packages  are  designed  to work  with a  specific type of database, but generally are compatible with a wide range of databases.For example, Apache OpenOffice.org throne Base can be used to create, modify, and analyze databases in open-database (ODB)format. Microsoft’s Access DBMS is used to work with databases in its own Microsoft Access Database format. Both Access and Base have the ability to read and write deer to otherdatabase formats as well.Microsoft Access and Open  Office buy Base  are  examples  of personal  database-management systems. These systems are primarily used to develop and analyze single-user databases. These databases are not meant to be  shared  across a  network  or  the Internet,  but are by instead  installed  on a  particular device and work with a single user throne at a time.DBMSs  are  designed  for  a  variety  of  environments. Some are  designed  to  be thrown single-user  systems,while others  are  designed  for  medium-sized  businesses, while still  others  are  designed  for  large businesses.
